        <p className="mb-3">
          The Tibetan medical system is one of the world's oldest known medical
          traditions. It is an integral part of Tibetan culture and has been
          developed through many centuries. We believe that the origin of the
          Tibetan medical tradition is as old as civilization itself.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          Because humankind has depended on nature for sustenance and survival,
          the instinctive urge to health and accumulated knowledge has guided us
          to discover certain remedies for common ailments from natural sources.
          For example, applying residual barley from <em>chang</em> (Tibetan
          wine) on swollen body parts, drinking hot water for indigestion, and
          using melted butter for bleeding are some of the therapies that arose
          from practical experiences and gradually formed the basis for the art
          of healing in Tibet. The Tibetan medical heritage is based on the book
          of the Four Tantras (<em>rGyud-bZhi</em>), which remains the
          fundamental medical text even today.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The era from the beginning of human civilisation to the advent of
          Buddhism in Tibet can be termed as the pre-Buddhist era. During that
          time, Bon tradition flourished in Tibet and Bon medical practice
          influenced and enriched the existing Tibetan Medical knowledge and
          practice. It has been clearly mentioned in a Bon text titled
          "Jam-ma tsa-drel" that around 200 B.C., during the emergence of the
          first Tibetan King Nyatri Tsenpo, there lived twelve scholars of Bon
          tradition including a medical scholar who treated diseases through
          medication and therapy. This indicates that Tibetans practiced
          medicine and there were Tibetan physicians even prior to the advent of
          Buddhism in Tibet.

        <p className="mb-3">
          Shakyamuni Buddha was born in circa 961 B.C., and he lived till 881
          BC. During his life time he taught Buddha Dharma (popularly known as
          Buddhism). Buddhism came to Tibet during the reign of King Thothori
          Nyantsen (245–364 A.D.) (according to <em>gSo-rig Kuns 'Dus</em>).
          The Buddhist teachings gradually spread and were assimilated into
          every part of Tibetan culture, becoming Tibet's state religion.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          The philosophy of Tibetan Medicine also got motivated by it and the
          influences are clearly visible in <em>rGyud-Zhi</em> (the principal
          Tibetan medical text). The incorporation of Buddhist views of the four
          immeasurable thoughts and six perfections in the prerequisite
          conditions of Tibetan physicians are testimony of these influences.

          bells to the Mahabodhi Stupa of Vajrasana and made prayers for their
          children's success in benefitting sentient beings. When the boy and

        <p className="mb-3">
          When they were in Vajrasana, Arya Tara prophesied that they would go

          visit Tibet. The King invited them to his Palace, Yumbu Lakhar, and
          gave his daughter Yidkyi Rolcha as a bride to Biji Gaje. It is
          believed that Biji Gaje and Bilha Gaje are still alive and exist in a

        <p className="mb-3">
          Rev. Khyenrab Norbu was born to Astrologer Ngawo-che and Yangchen in
          the Water Sheep year at Tsethang, southern Tibet. He was admitted to
          Ngachoe Monastery, and was known for his excellence in studies,
          intelligence, compassion and humbleness. As a result, he was selected
          from many young monks as a candidate to study medicine and went to
          Chagpori Medical College in Lhasa. There he was taught by Dr. Ngawang
          Choden. He passed his exams in a relatively short time.

          In order to preserve and expand Tibetan medicine, the Great Thirteenth
          Dalai Lama (1876–1933) in 1897 appointed Tekhang Jampa Thubwang and
          Jabung Damchoe Palden as his senior and junior physicians respectively,
          and ordered them to teach selected students. Khyenrab Norbu, Tenpa
          Yarphel and Tsultrim Nyandrag were chosen from Chagpori Medical
          College to study under the senior physician and they received teachings
          on <em>rGyud-bZhi</em> and its various commentaries.

        <p className="mb-3">
          Khyenrab Norbu also learned medicine, astrology, poetry and grammar. He
          was named "Yangchen rgyas pai Lodoe" as an honour to his hard work. The
          Great Thirteenth Dalai Lama established Lhasa Men-Tsee-Khang in the
          year of the Fire Dragon, 1916. Dr. Khyenrab Norbu was appointed to the

          The Chinese invaded Tibet from the east in 1949. On 10th March, 1959,
          the Chinese ruthlessly suppressed peaceful Tibetan demonstrations in
          Lhasa by artillery fire and bombardment. His Holiness the 14th Dalai
          Lama, followed by thousands of Tibetans, escaped into exile in India.

        <p className="mb-4">
          During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) the Chinese destroyed more
          than 6,000 monasteries, demolished statues, burnt religious and
          astrology-medicine books, destroyed forests, and wreaked unimaginable
          destruction to flora and fauna. As a direct consequence of Chinese
          repression, more than 1.2 million Tibetans died.

          The Chinese have used every possible means to exterminate the culture
          and identity of the Tibetan people. In order to preserve and promote
          the richness of Tibetan culture, many institutions, monasteries and
          schools were re-established in India under the auspices of His
